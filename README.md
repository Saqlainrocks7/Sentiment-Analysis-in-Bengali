## Overview
Social media these days is generating a vast amount of sentiment rich data in the   form of tweets, status updates, blog posts etc. Sentiment analysis of this user generated data is very useful in knowing the opinion of the crowd. It deals with identifying and classifying opinions or sentiments expressed in source text. Sentiment analysis of such data helps us to understand the proper meaning of the data. It is an application of natural language processing, also known as emotion extraction or opinion mining.

## Motivation
Usually sentiments can be varied in cultures and languages. On sentiment analysis, an extensive amount of research works can be seen for well-resourced languages like English, Japanese etc. However, such works are relatively less observed for low-resourced language like Bengali. Bengali is the world's seventh most spoken native language.In 2010 ,it was voted as the sweetest language by UNESCO.  Digital contents in Bengali text are increasing with the advancements of World Wide Web (WWW) to express the sentiment of content originators from mixed perspectives. These high voluminous unstructured web contents can be utilized to build smarter tools to assist people through Natural Language Processing (NLP). Though Bengali NLP tools are still inadequate due to its inherent complexities, research on Sentiment Analysis in Bengali is flourishing as a challenging area and is getting researcher's attention at a rapid pace.
